# Todo List Application (JavaScript, HTML, CSS)

## Description:
Developed a dynamic and user-friendly to-do list application utilizing JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This application provides essential features for managing tasks:

* Task Creation: Users can effortlessly add new tasks by entering them in a designated input field and clicking a button.
* Task Completion: Completed tasks can be marked by clicking a checkbox associated with each task, visually indicating their status.
* Task Removal: Unnecessary tasks can be easily removed from the list using a dedicated button or functionality (e.g., clicking a delete icon).
* Persistent Storage: The application leverages browser storage (e.g., Local Storage) to persistently store the list of tasks. This ensures that even after refreshing the page or closing the browser, the user's tasks remain accessible upon revisiting the application.
